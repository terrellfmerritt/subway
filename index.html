<h1>Subway Station Visits</h2>
<p>
  Testing a way to keep track of how many New York City Subway stations I have visited. See below.
</p>

{% for station in site.data.stations %}
	<h2>BMT Astoria Line</h2>
	{% if line = "BMT Astoria" %}
	<p>
		<strong>{{ station.stop_name }}</strong> ({{ station.line }}) | Visited? {{ station.visited }}
	</p>
	{% endif %}
{% endfor %}
